    Marrying T and L
    Marrying E and B


Triangulating prime component with 2 members:
    A, T
This component is a clique of cost 4

Triangulating prime component with 3 members:
    L, T, E
This component is a clique of cost 8

Triangulating prime component with 4 members:
    B, S, L, E

    Using the best greedy heuristic for triangulation


Triangulating prime component with 3 members:
    B, D, E
This component is a clique of cost 8

Triangulating prime component with 2 members:
    X, E
This component is a clique of cost 4


Total cost of triangulation for all prime components is 40

Cliques:

Clique 6, 2 members, table size = 4:
    E, X

Clique 5, 3 members, table size = 8:
    E, B, D

Clique 4, 3 members, table size = 8:
    E, B, S

Clique 3, 3 members, table size = 8:
    E, S, L

Clique 2, 3 members, table size = 8:
    E, L, T

Clique 1, 2 members, table size = 4:
    T, A

Total clique table size: 40


The junction forest:

Creating junction tree with clique 6 as root ...

Cliques 5 and 6 linked, separator has 1 member and table size = 2:
    E

Cliques 4 and 5 linked, separator has 2 members and table size = 4:
    E, B

Cliques 3 and 4 linked, separator has 2 members and table size = 4:
    E, S

Cliques 2 and 3 linked, separator has 2 members and table size = 4:
    E, L

Cliques 1 and 2 linked, separator has 1 member and table size = 2:
    T


Assignment of potentials to cliques:

    Node X assigned to clique 6
    Node B assigned to clique 4
    Node D assigned to clique 5
    Node A assigned to clique 1
    Node S assigned to clique 4
    Node L assigned to clique 3
    Node T assigned to clique 1
    Node E assigned to clique 2
